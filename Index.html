          About
      </h2>
      
      <p> I am a web developer with a strong passion for writing codes and making sure people get 
        the best website possible. I put my all into any project i work on. I started gaining 
        interest in coding like 2 years ago when i first got recommended to try out python. 
        At first, i was hesitant but when i started to study i noticed it was actually a 
        very fun language so i have been hooked ever since which is why i am currently 
        studying to become a full stack web developer. When i am not coding, 
        i am probably outside taking a walk or working out because it helps me refresh 
        my mind so i can think clearly of different ideas.</p>

      <p> I am currently working on a password generator and would put a link to it when done. 
          You can find my recent works on my github which would be linked below. 
          I create webpages with the help of html, css and javascript. I have worked on a few 
          projects like refactoring websites to make sure they are functioning properly 
          and also to make sure they are very accessible to everyone. When i get projects you can be 
          rest assured that i would put in my best and you would also be receiving a high quality webpage or application in return.</p>
